🔍 Insights & Findings
1️⃣ Sales & Item Performance

Fruits & Snacks are the top revenue-generating categories.

Household and Frozen Foods also contribute significantly.

Seafood and Breakfast items show the lowest sales, indicating low demand or limited availability.

2️⃣ Fat Content Analysis

Regular-fat products contribute more revenue than low-fat products, suggesting customer preference leans toward taste rather than health-focused options.

Across Tier 1 outlets, both fat categories perform well, with regular-fat items leading.

3️⃣ Outlet Type Performance

Supermarket Type 1 dominates sales:

Higher total sales

More items sold

Higher item visibility

Grocery Stores contribute less revenue, indicating limited scale or reach.

4️⃣ Outlet Establishment Trend

Sales increased steadily from 2012 to 2016, peaking around 2016.

A decline after 2017 suggests:

Market saturation

Increased competition

Possible operational challenges

5️⃣ Outlet Location & Size

Tier 1 locations generate 100% of total sales in the current filter context.

Medium-sized outlets outperform small outlets in total sales, indicating better inventory variety and customer footfall.
